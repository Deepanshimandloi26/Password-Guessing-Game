# Password-Guessing-Game
The Password Guessing Game in Python challenges the user to guess a secret word chosen randomly from a list based on the selected difficulty level (easy, medium, or hard). The game provides hints by revealing correct letters in the correct positions. The user continues guessing until they match the secret word, with the number of attempts tracked.
